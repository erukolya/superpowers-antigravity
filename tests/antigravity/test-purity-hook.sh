# Test: PreToolUse Purity Hook (Behavioral)
# Feeds fixture PreToolUse JSON payloads into hooks/purity-check.sh over
# stdin and asserts the emitted decision JSON + exit code. This is a real
# behavioral test of the script (not a grep of its source): it does not
# know or care whether the jq branch or the python3 fallback branch is
# doing the work internally. Deterministic, agy-free.
#
# NOTE on fixture authoring: every payload below is built as a single-quoted
# bash literal and delivered with `printf '%s' "$payload"` (never a bare
# `printf '<literal>'`), so bash/printf never re-interpret the \n / \" bytes
# that are meant for the hook's own JSON parser. Using `printf '<literal>'`
# directly here would let printf's own escape processing turn `\n` into a
# real newline before the hook ever saw it, breaking the JSON.
